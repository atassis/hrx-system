# Native XDNA execution coverage

`execution_test` and `execution_test_instance` exercise image loading, binding,
queue submission, readback and resource retirement through libamdf. They select
the appropriate image for the available device family.

`vector_copy_npu2_test` exercises C++ import, bytecode linking, compilation and
native execution on NPU2 hardware. It compiles against the exact profile the
attached endpoint admits (`iree-xdna-run --print_target`), never a guessed
device family. It is an explicit hardware test (`manual` in Bazel). Its compiler
and importer dependencies are optional; the common importer package has no
dependency on this native consumer.

The same C++ source supplies scalar and 512-bit vector copy controls. Two workers
process three records each, covering zero, one, four, nineteen and twenty blocks,
nonzero byte origins, and different source/destination strides. An independent
scalar oracle checks every output word, untouched gaps, a trailing binding guard
and unchanged input bytes. These checks qualify correctness, not performance.

```sh
iree-bazel-build --config=asan --config=loom-importer-cxx \
  --//loom/config/target:enable=xdna --//loom/config/emit:enable=xdna \
  --//libamdf/config:enabled=true \
  //experimental/xdna/cts:vector_copy_npu2_test

benchmark-lock --label=xdna-copy -- \
  iree-bazel-test --config=asan --config=loom-importer-cxx \
  --//loom/config/target:enable=xdna --//loom/config/emit:enable=xdna \
  --//libamdf/config:enabled=true \
  //experimental/xdna/cts:vector_copy_npu2_test
```

`integer_shifts_npu2_test` checks scalar word and split-word shifts using streamed
packets. An independent integer oracle covers all legal dynamic counts, bounded
count ranges, constant word boundaries, logical and signed right shifts, and
retained high words. The 37,888 results include edge bit patterns and seeded
random inputs; binding tails and unchanged inputs are checked as well. This test
uses the same native execution path and resource lease without requiring the
C++ importer.
